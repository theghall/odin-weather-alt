## Your Weather

For The Odin Project

A simple weather app to display basic data retrieved from Open Weather Map.  Features use of javascript async/await.

To use you need to get an API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/).

Then in the dist directory create a file called config.js and put the following in it:
```
const config = {
  OWMKEY : '<Insert your API key>'
}
```

Then you can open dist/index.html in your browser of choice.
